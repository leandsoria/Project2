                <h2>Coffee</h2>
                <p>Coffee is often consumed alongside (or instead of) breakfast by many at home or when eating out at
                    diners
                    or cafeterias. It is often served at the end of a formal meal, normally with a dessert, and at times
                    with an after-dinner mint, especially when consumed at a restaurant or dinner party.[citation
                    needed]

                    Break
                    A coffee break in the United States and elsewhere is a short mid-morning rest period granted to
                    employees in business and industry, corresponding with the Commonwealth terms "elevenses", "smoko"
                    (in
                    Australia), "morning tea", "tea break", or even just "tea". An afternoon coffee break, or afternoon
                    tea,
                    often occurs as well.

                    The coffee break originated in the late 19th century in Stoughton, Wisconsin, with the wives of
                    Norwegian immigrants. The city celebrates this every year with the Stoughton Coffee Break
                    Festival.[214]
                    In 1951, Time noted that "[s]ince the war, the coffee break has been written into union
                    contracts".[215]
                    The term subsequently became popular through a Pan-American Coffee Bureau ad campaign of 1952 which
                    urged consumers, "Give yourself a Coffee-Break – and Get What Coffee Gives to You."[216] John B.
                    Watson,
                    a behavioral psychologist who worked with Maxwell House later in his career, helped to popularize
                    coffee
                    breaks within the American culture.[217] Coffee breaks usually last from 10 to 20 minutes and
                    frequently
                    occur at the end of the first third of the work shift. In some companies and some civil service, the
                    coffee break may be observed formally at a set hour. In some places, a cart with hot and cold
                    beverages
                    and cakes, breads and pastries arrives at the same time morning and afternoon, an employer may
                    contract
                    with an outside caterer for daily service, or coffee breaks may take place away from the actual
                    work-area in a designated cafeteria or tea room. More generally, the phrase "coffee break" has also
                    come
                    to denote any break from work.</p>

                <h2>Cats</h2>
                <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to
                    distinguish
                    it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral
                    cat;
                    the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for
                    companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
                    registries.[6]

                    The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                    reflexes,
                    sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell
                    are
                    well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                    growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn
                    and
                    dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
                    frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and
                    perceives pheromones.[8]</p>

                <h2>Dreams</h2>
                <p>A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily
                    in
                    the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and function of dreams are not fully
                    understood,
                    although they have been a topic of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout
                    recorded
                    history. Dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an
                    underlying message. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology.

                    Dreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and
                    resembles that of being awake. REM sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during
                    sleep.
                    At times, dreams may occur during other stages of sleep. However, these dreams tend to be much less
                    vivid or memorable. The length of a dream can vary; they may last for a few seconds, or
                    approximately
                    20–30 minutes. People are more likely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM
                    phase. The average person has three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven;
                    however,
                    most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten. Dreams tend to last longer as the night
                    progresses.
                    During a full eight-hour night sleep, most dreams occur in the typical two hours of REM. Dreams
                    related to waking-life experiences are associated with REM theta activity, which suggests that
                    emotional
                    memory processing takes place in REM sleep.</p>
